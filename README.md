## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Oasis Infobyte Java Development Internship – Task 2**, where I developed a simple yet fun **Number Guessing Game** using **Java** and **VS Code**.

The program randomly generates a number between **1 and 100**, and the user tries to guess it within limited attempts.  
It provides real-time hints — *“Too High”* or *“Too Low”* — and awards points based on how quickly the correct number is guessed.

This task helped me strengthen my **logic-building**, **loop control**, **user input handling**, and **randomization** concepts in Java.

## 💻 How It Works
1. The computer randomly generates a number between **1 – 100**.  
2. You have **5 attempts** to guess it.  
3. After each guess, the game tells you whether your number is higher or lower.  
4. Points are given based on how quickly you guess the number.  
5. You can choose to **play again** or **exit** after each round.
